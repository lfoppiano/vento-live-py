@AbdiSaugaa @ThatArabBoy Yea everyone only knew about them since 2008 after they won the euro and the world cup.
@ActionJackson85 gold is too high...so flight from the euro will probably be to the US$. Euro flight to gold would be a silly safety net
@ActionJackson85 hmm agreed &amp;amp; not.. only b/c I think it is a little simpler than that. all it will take is the collapse of the euro.
@aggedor_Hobbit @novid7 the Saddam boys aren't using theirs anymore...musta been a war trophy

@bbcqt . . Reduce the cost of living so people have the money to pay off their debts, the only growth is in debt management companies.
@bbcquestiontime I keep hearing about debt but no-one has said who the money is owed to ? Am I missing something ?
@betsyisvapid Yah. Is why we are in debt to begin with. Sort out tax = save everything.
@bfrischy7 100% backed by fed govt now. Defaults=taxpayer loss. Also, after 25 years, the debt is forgiven...more taxpayer loss.
@BillBoyle24 very safe to say. @barackobama is far to the right of Merkel, Sarkozy, even Cameron @chrislehmann
@bmlsupporters what about Mandela? You're helping support my case, Russia &amp;amp; Mugabe aren't true democracies, France is - where's Sarkozy?

@DavidSweeney77 @smellmehelmet @karlgleeson69 @liamwalsh28 @jakegriffin139 @banjo365 euro's? #TypicalSlowSweeney
@declankenny94 Wha...? That's an utter non-sequitur. Forget parties; this govt has to deal with debt and deficit. No debate—that's fact.
@declankenny94 What's dependent? Bank's bad debt can surely only be a product of 'our' requests for loans we couldn't honour.
@denisfitz remove our troops, reduce debt, and let them figure their own crap out. We should be more worried about Mexican drug cartel!

@HomamAgeel is it a nordic version? or euro version?
@Honeybal of Hillary, Sarkozy, Cameron, Bernard Henri-Lévy ... not of Saif ... 1 day U will understand what I'm saying now.
@iainmartin1 because sovereign debt crisis exacerbated much more due to bank fragility; while crisis kicked off thanks to their crash in 08
@iainmartin1 not in the case of Greece, sure, but Spain had a low debt to GDP and Italy balanced budgets before crisis.
@IAmJermainDefoe You have been through so much shit recently and still remain a true pro, Good luck in the euro's mate and god bless coys

@jacquep I'm not sure about how offensive he was this time, but I heard he's now had a go at Sarkozy and Hollande and not constructively
@JCDOLAN ...Saddam Hussain is not a hero!
@JCLaLiga You had any anti-post euro 2012 bets??
@JellyTim You think a landlord would be worried about the newco paying rent? A debt-free newco Rangers unable to pay rent? Very unlikely.

@Joe_Tindle I have two weeks away in the sun watching euro ;) haha
@Joeneverleft IIRC he did last year though when he was in France visiting Sarkozy.
@JohnDCGow Assad has not learnt from the fate of Saddam,Mubarak or Gaddafi,all dictators fall.
@JohnOMahony8 well considering that a Sheikh owns Man City and The Glazers (who owe 600 million in debt) own united, City would be richer
@JonBradfield stripper foam party silent disco with Sarkozy Dj-ing.
@joncstone @hopisen I don't see why it would. Hollande is pursuing same s-term fiscal policy framework as Sarkozy.
@justinwolfers $5 trillion in new debt last 3+yrs and jobless problem every bit heinous suggests that's failure thinking?
@KAHall95 same very happy as long as its run correctly from now on e.g. Paying off the debt as they promised! Badge needs a new design tho

@LAuthenticiTee nicholas sarkozy is ur grandmother on (ur muddas sides) - sisters- grandneices-mum. (If u didn't no that's ur mum.)
@liamooo Sick to the back teeth about these circular arguments about debt. At least @ballyhea14 had the cojones to do something different.
@LibertyStreetTP Almost 100% of today's debt is Bush debt.What part of about 98%  dont you get?
@LibertyStreetTP AND Reagan started the debt run up so no more Reagan either.We need Clinton policies which Obama says he wants.
@LibertyStreetTP And the overall long term debt does not have to be paid off in 1 yr so your arguement is disingenuous or a lie to be blunt
@LibertyStreetTP What part of Clinton PAID DOWN DEBT dont you get?What part of GOP REJECTED HIS PLAN 100% dont you get? #reality
@little_mavis But neither did we have credit/debit cards and thought of running up debt was anathema. Mortgage &amp;amp; bills were worrying enough.
@llorentefer19 u and i is same birthday!!fight EURO!

@MartinShovel Concession to Sarkozy (early retirement)?
@maryleong : Wow! Advice from an EU advisor. The EU is ready to fall apart &amp;amp; the debt dam is ready to burst!
@MatofKilburnia shall we discuss the ever popular Presidents Sarkozy, Putin and Mugabe? They're much better alternatives!
@MaybeUMisheard Given Hollande's deficit reduction plan is all of one year slower than Sarkozy's, it's hardly living on the never-never.
@megalicer i will be in debt tomorrow.

@mshams84 Somehow Sistani got them to stop fighting from inside Ali's shrine and they listened. Before Saddam was executed in 06.
@MShapland @nsinclairemep Well the euro is the cause of a sovereign debt crisis. In effect the Euro is going to become a"sovereign" currency
@mtc_london Do you think Eurobonds will do the trick? Piling Greece &amp;amp; Germany into the same debt risks making sub-prime look a success
@NabilahDanish moy esok public holiday ke ?
@NCJ29 no it definitely wasnt. 'fuck you saddam Husain of Iraq'
@NDTaco Similarly everyone wants access to higher education without careening into a lifetime of debt.  Lending bodies need control.
@nealcol @DTguardian Racism gonna be the focal point at the euro's instead of football.  sad!
@NickyButt @sethmeyers21 @Futfanatico @AnalyseFootball @SteveNash would yall want to join my euro 2012 fantasy league McDonald's game?
@NikkiGuest You were right. On ITV he said Sarkozy's a nasty jumped up little spiv and Hollande a second rate provincial school master
@notourdebt #vinb NAMA gave money to IBRC to pay the promissory note - the gov will issue a sovereign bond to cover this loan= HARDER debt
@NSinclaireMEP Yes. The Euro was clearly Ted Heath's Idea. He alone is responsible for the debt crisis across Europe. Take your pills
@OHO211 Also, you forget cutting VAT would boost confidence and demand, which is good for growth and debt has gone up under ur govt.
@oipah yeah. :) I'm support them on euro cup. :)
@omerhizir at least I wrote Nicolas Sarkozy, did I get any points? :)
@onebuttonmonkey have heard PK before, will read + get back 2 u. Fair point but more spending + debt is poss going to burden less well off.
@OOkikiola Ghaddafi was one of the strongest too...so was Saddam....so was Mubarak
@OutFrontCNN No joke: 3 years of applying all fed income tax returns to debt will generate apprx $1.6 trillion with not one tax increase.

@PennyRed me. Dropped out of art school to do Lit. Lectured and completed MA. Am now a milliner with own business . With £20000 debt.

@psalm82 @ZeitgeistGhost I believe the debt ceiling is the limit to what Congress is allowed to borrow. Am I incorrect?
@psalm82 @ZeitgeistGhost If Obama hadn't borrowed so much in 2009 and 2010, we wouldn't have had to raise the debt ceiling in 2011.
@quadrant2 @owenjones84 @rjward2009 merci, right now Owen Deficit =\ Debt, Income =\ Wealth. I'll be testing you next week...

@reece_sim Soon. I have a whole summer (well, and after) of doing nothing, so I'll borrow the boxset off my mate after the Euro's. Promise.

@TheStalwart disagree. We knew the gdp gap was ~ $2tril and mustered 800mil to fight it due to fear of long run debt.
@thisisnotme93 Euro brought US style realistic interest rates. Do you really want to go back to City of London rates of 20+%?
@thisisnotme93 Germans worrying about the 1930s? It was unsustainable debt then that caused the disaster, just like now
@tigerseye42 .... I'll post pictures on Facebook when I get back. You can certainly see where the Spanish national debt went...
@timwilsoncomau No, but debt financing (borrowing from the future to buy stuff now) is same regardless of who uses it.

I hate being in debt
I hate the fact Edin Dzeko will not be playing in the Euro 2012. :(((
I have discovered the whole problem with the National Debt. Most of us work 5 days a week, and the government spends 7.
I hope it's Holland that knocks England out (if they meet) of Euro 2012 after watching that mars bar advert

I will forever be in debt to god for blessing me!
I wonder if President Sarkozy ever got caught being Sarkoztic in a conversation
If all the billionaires threw a couple mil in a pile im sure it would pay off half the us debt if not all of it
If all the nations in the world are in debt, who’s got all the money?
If debt is so bad for govt, but interest rates are kept low to help individuals/businesses borrow...
If I was doing the economy question in politics I would just write OUR NATIONAL DEBT IS ONE AND A HALF TRILLION POUNDS OMG #bbcqt
if our economy &amp;amp; the top economies of the world are failing, what's gonna happen if they all fail? we're all so in debt nobody can get out.
If Scott Walker were president of France instead of Sarkozy he would have survived reelection.
If someone wants to bring me a big ol' bag of dem Hershey's Cookies and Creme drops I will be forever in your debt.
If you're going to go into debt for it, it might as well be worth the hassle.
I'm 25K in debt and I'm not even 18 yet
